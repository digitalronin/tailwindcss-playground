# Tailwind CSS Playground

Minimal project to enable playing with tailwindcss.

Based on: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-from-zero-to-production

The project should have as few dependencies as possible, and should support hot reloading to make developing tailwindcss UI examples as painless as possible.
